Remote Virtual Interface

Remote Virtual Interface (rvi) is very useful for analysing. Install latest
Xcode and run it (needed once to install some programs/scripts). Connect
iphone/ipad via USB. Lookup UDID in iTunes (click on serial number in main
page and right click on UDID). On macbook run "rvictl -s <udid>". You now have
a rvi0 device on your macbook on which you can snoop and see all network
traffic of iphone/ipad (wireless/cellular). End with rvictl -x <udid>. Have
fun :-)</udid></udid>
