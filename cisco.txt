Miscellaneous
=============

Netstat-like output of listening ports

    show ip ports all

SSH
===

Check if SSH is enabled

    show ip ssh

If not enables, generating a crypto key could help

    crypto key generate rsa

It may be necessary to add a domain name first

    ip domain name example.com

Add SSH public key for a user
-----------------------------

    ip ssh pubkey-chain
        username user
            key-string
                Copy the entire public key as appears in the cat id_rsa.pub including the ssh-rsa and username@hostname
                Please note that some IOS versions will accept maximum 254 characters.
                You can paste multiple lines.
            exit
        exit
    exit

DHCP
====

Server
------

Show current bindings:

    show ip dhcp binding

Delete binding(s):

    clear ip dhcp binding {address|*}

Determine fields sent by clients:

     debug ip dhcp server packet

Client
------

Release or renew DHCP address:

    release dhcp ethernet 0/0
    renew dhcp ethernet 0/0


Show Date/Time
==============

    show clock [detail]


Access Point upgrade
====================

Note: access points can operate in autonomous or unified modes, with the
latter they need centralized control. Autonomous images have k9w7 in their
name, while LWAPP images have k9w8.

    archive download-sw /leave-old-sw /reload tftp://10.10.10.3/ap801-k9w7-tar.152-2.JB

Once the new version is tested, the old version can be deleted:

    delete /force /recursive flash:ap801-k9w7-mx.124-21a.JA1


Access Point recovery from bootloader
=====================================

1. Enter bootloader mode from the main router

    service-module wlan-ap 0 reset bootloader


2. Enter AP

    service-module wlan-ap 0 session

3. Configure an IP address in bootloader mode and init TFTP subsystem

    set IP_ADDR 10.10.10.2
    set NETMASK 255.255.255.248
    set DEFAULT_ROUTER 10.10.10.1
    tftp_init

4. Get and extract a tar image from a TFTP server

    tar -xtract tftp://10.10.10.3/ap801-k9w7-tar.152-2.JB flash:


5. Set the new image as the boot image check variables and boot

    set BOOT flash:ap801-k9w7-mx.152-2.JB/ap801-k9w7-mx.152-2.JB
    set
    boot

6. If the configuration gets wiped out, default username/password/enable are
   all Cisco.


Static routes between VRFs
==========================

    ip vrf Example
     rd 1:1
     route-target 1:1
    interface FastEthernet0/0
     description Interface in a VRF
     ip vrf forwarding Example
     ip address 192.0.2.1 255.255.255.0
     no shutdown
    interface FastEthernet0/1
     description Interface in a global table
     ip address 199.99.9.1 255.255.255.0
    ! This command adds a route into the VRF
    ! that points to a route reachable via the global table
    ip route vrf Example 223.255.255.0 255.255.255.0 199.99.9.2 global
    ! This command adds a route into the global table
    ! that points to a route reachable in the VRF Example
    ip route 126.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 FastEthernet0/0 192.0.2.2

This way, there is a route added to the VRF Example pointing to the network
223.255.255.0/24 via the next hop 199.99.9.2 (somewhere behind the Fa0/1
interface). Also, another route to 126.0.0.0/8 is added to the global routing
table which is reachable via the next hop 199.0.2.2 somewhere behind the Fa0/0
interface in the VRF Example.
