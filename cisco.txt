Access Point upgrade
====================

Note: access points can operate in autonomous or unified modes, with the
latter they need centralized control. Autonomous images have k9w7 in their
name, while LWAPP images have k9w8.

    archive download-sw /leave-old-sw /reload tftp://10.10.10.3/ap801-k9w7-tar.152-2.JB

Once the new version is tested, the old version can be deleted:

    delete /force /recursive flash:ap801-k9w7-mx.124-21a.JA1

    service-module wlan-ap 0 reset bootloader


2. Enter AP

    service-module wlan-ap 0 session

3. Configure an IP address in bootloader mode and init TFTP subsystem

    set IP_ADDR 10.10.10.2
    set NETMASK 255.255.255.248
    set DEFAULT_ROUTER 10.10.10.1
    tftp_init

4. Get and extract a tar image from a TFTP server

    tar -xtract tftp://10.10.10.3/ap801-k9w7-tar.152-2.JB flash:


5. Set the new image as the boot image check variables and boot
